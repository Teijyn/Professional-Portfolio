# Joseph Pham - Professional Portfolio
## üìå About Me  

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Joseph, a Technical Project Manager and Analyst with 6+ years of experience in enterprise system integration, process improvement, and data-driven decision-making. I‚Äôve led cross-functional initiatives at Tesla, focusing on tooling automation, digital workflow optimization, and scalable system design.

üîß I‚Äôm passionate about solving complex problems at the intersection of technology and operations. To drive impact, I use tools like SQL, JIRA, Confluence, Tableau, Microsoft Office Suite, and Postman. I also apply lean manufacturing principles to streamline processes and improve operational efficiency.

üìÅ This GitHub showcases some of my professional and exploratory projects in data analytics, system documentation, and process optimization. Let‚Äôs connect!

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Portfolio  
A collection of hands-on projects showcasing my experience in data analytics, systems integration, and process improvement. Each project reflects practical, real-world applications and technical problem-solving.

üìå***Tesla Manufacturing SQL Query Collection***

**Code:**
[Manufacturing Queries](https://github.com/Teijyn/ProjectPortfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Queries.sql)

**Goal:**  To support real-time production data extraction and decision-making through a robust set of SQL queries tailored for manufacturing operations.

**Description:**  This repository features a structured collection of SQL queries developed to monitor, analyze, and improve manufacturing performance in a live production environment. The queries are designed to extract actionable insights related to production output, tooling errors, shift performance, downtime events, and inventory turnover.

**Skills:**  
- Real-time SQL data extraction and reporting  
- Multi-level JOINs and subquery logic  
- Downtime and defect trend analysis  
- Lean manufacturing data analytics  
- Tooling and shift-based performance tracking

**Technology:**  
- MySQL / SQL  
- Live data source simulation  

**Results:**  Enabled timely insights into key production metrics by delivering scalable, production-ready SQL queries. These queries helped identify high-defect trends, optimize resource planning, and support lean initiatives, reflecting hands-on experience with real-time manufacturing systems.


üìå***JIRA ‚Äì Agile Project Tracking***

**Goal:**   To manage and track technical projects with precision using JIRA, enabling Agile delivery and real-time visibility across cross-functional teams.

**Description:**  I‚Äôve used JIRA to lead and support enterprise system integrations, tooling deployments, and process improvement initiatives. This includes managing sprint cycles, user stories, issue tracking, and stakeholder alignment throughout the project lifecycle.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Created and managed custom Scrum and Kanban boards  
- Developed and refined epics, user stories, subtasks, and workflows  
- Used advanced JQL queries to build filtered dashboards and reports  
- Facilitated sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives  
- Aligned development and operations through ticket tracking and priority workflows

**Technology:**  
- JIRA Software (Cloud and Server)  
- Agile / Scrum frameworks  
- JQL (JIRA Query Language)  
- Integrated tools (e.g., Slack, Confluence)

**Outcome:**  
Improved team coordination, reduced sprint carryover, and increased on-time project delivery through effective Agile planning and real-time status tracking.


üìå***Confluence ‚Äì Collaborative Documentation***

**Goal:**  To create centralized, accessible, and living documentation for technical projects and team processes using Confluence.

**Description:**  I‚Äôve used Confluence extensively to support engineering programs by developing documentation spaces, SOPs, integration plans, and status pages. This ensured clear communication, easy onboarding, and organizational knowledge retention.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Built structured documentation spaces for systems integration and tooling workflows  
- Linked Confluence pages to JIRA tickets for traceable project artifacts  
- Created knowledge bases for internal tools, best practices, and validation steps  
- Designed templates for sprint summaries, project retrospectives, and decision logs  
- Maintained real-time dashboards and updates for leadership and project teams

**Technology:**  
- Atlassian Confluence  
- Confluence-JIRA integration  
- Visual flowcharts, macros, and page templates

**Outcome:**  Streamlined knowledge sharing across teams and improved execution quality by making documentation accessible, consistent, and continuously updated.
